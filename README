=== serialphrase ===

numbers of things. Because who wants to try to remember serial
numbers?

=== INSPIRATIONAL QUOTE ===

Prophet 60091, this is the flight number of our galactic sun.
Prophet 60091, before we start you should know 
that you're not the only one 
who can hurt me. 

SH10151, this is the serial number of our orbital gun.
SH10151, you better be sure before you leave me for another one,
you can hurt me. 
I can hurt you. 
You can hurt. 
You can hurt me.
I can hurt you.

But you better be sure before you leave me for another one, 
I can hurt you.

You can hurt me.
But you better be sure before you leave me for another one...
