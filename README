=== serialphrase ===

A tool for generating unique, easily remembered names for naming large
numbers of things. Because who wants to try to remember serial
numbers?

Usage :

    ./phrases.py <n>

Where <n> is the number of unique phrases desired. For example :

    $ ./phrases.py 5
    the unquestionably fine baboon
    the urgently helpful halyard
    the hitherto content saucer
    the playfully enchanted centipede
    the cautiously worthy cheese

Within one run, there should be no repeats, or an error will be
produced. 

The word lists provided should furnish up to 2,509,200 unique phrases.
You can, of course, increase the number of possible phrases by adding
words to the lists. The words included in the lists were ones I was
able to think of at the time.

=== INSPIRATIONAL QUOTE ===

Prophet 60091, this is the flight number of our galactic sun.
Prophet 60091, before we start you should know 
that you're not the only one 
who can hurt me. 

SH10151, this is the serial number of our orbital gun.
SH10151, you better be sure before you leave me for another one,
you can hurt me. 

    -- Hooverphonic, 2 Wicky
